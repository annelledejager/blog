I'm not the kind of developer who ressearches and compares tools before picking and using them. I prefer to jump right in and discover. 

Jekyll was recommend by a friend. I tried it, liked it and my blog is currently generated using it.

<blockquote>
	Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through a converter (like Markdown) and our Liquid renderer, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.

Why I like Jekyll? I can write markup, push to a Github repository and host my blog for free. There are also a variety of out-of-the-box <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">themes</a> to choose from.

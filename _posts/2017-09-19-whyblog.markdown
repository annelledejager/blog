description: why I started a blog

I decided to start blogging after listening to a talk by Lorna Jane <a href="https://lornajane.net/">Lorna Jane</a> at <a href="https://craft-conf.com/">Craft Conference</a> this year. The title of her talk was "Becoming Polyglot". Her talk was very inspiring. What I got from it was that she kept a tech blog and she highly recommended it. Her point for keeping one was that no one can remember everything and a blog is the perfect way to look up something you've discovered a few months ago. 

I didn't immediately start my blog after Lorna's talk. It was a bit intimidating. Why would anyone want to read what I think, discover and write? 

A few months later my personal notes filled with self discovery and google lookups started to become lengthy and unorganized. I used these notes daily and found it very useful, but I accidently removed the writing app along with all my precious notes. It was then when it hit me, I need a more permanent location for my notes. 

## Why would anyone want to read what I think and write, I ask. Well that's not the the point. This blog is for me. 


If my blog can help anyone else, then that's a bonus.

##### My personal note keeper is <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/">Bear - a writing app</a>. I highly recommend it.

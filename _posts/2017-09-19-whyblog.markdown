description: why I started a blog

I decided to start blogging after attending a talk by Lorna Jane <a href="https://lornajane.net/">Lorna Jane</a> at <a href="https://craft-conf.com/">Craft Conference</a> earlier this year. The title of her talk was "Becoming Polyglot". What I got from her talk was that she kept a blog and highly recommended it. Her point for keeping one was that no one can remember everything and a blog is the perfect way to quickly look up something you've discovered or resolved a few months ago. 

I didn't immediately start a blog after Lorna's talk. It was a bit intimidating. Why would anyone want to read what I think, discover and write? 

A few months later my personal notes filled with self discovery and google lookups started to become lengthy. I used these notes daily and found it very useful, but I accidently deleted the writing app along with all my precious notes. It was then when it hit me - I need a more permanent location for them. 

Side note, <a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/">Bear - a writing app</a>, is my personal note keeper. I highly recommend it. 

# Why would anyone want to read what I write, I ask. Well that's not the the point. This blog is for me.

If my blog can help anyone else, that's a bonus.

#### Assumptions

- You have a GitHub account
- You have a project on your local computer you want add to GitHub
- You are working on a Mac

#### Steps

- Create a repository on GitHub

<blockquote>
To avoid errors, do not initialize the new repository with README, license, or gitignore files. You can add these files after your project has been pushed to GitHub.

</blockquote>

- Run these commands in your terminal

{% highlight ruby %}

git init
git add YourProjectFolderName
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourGithubUsername/RepositoryName.git 
git push -u origin master

{% endhighlight %}

Note that command `git remote add origin https://github.com/YourGithubUsername/RepositoryName.git` can be exchanged for `git remote add origin git@github.com/YourGithubUsername/RepositoryName.git`.

Some issues might occur when your remote repository changed after the init command eg. you added a README. Try the following command `git push —force origin master`, but be cautious. This is the only time I would recommend using the `--force` command ever. 

<blockquote>
Git's push --force is destructive because it unconditionally overwrites the remote repository with whatever you have locally

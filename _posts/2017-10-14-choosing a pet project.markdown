I started a pet project for the first time in 2017. This is rare for a software engineer 4 years into their career. 

I had a few misconceptions when it came to pet projects that held me back. One of my excuses were that I didn't want to spend my free time in front of a computer as well, but instead I would watch 10 hours straight of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/">Game of Thrones</a>. 

I use to think that a pet project meant that you're super passionate about it and you believe it could be the next <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>. I also thought that a pet project had to do something, fulfill some sort of need. 

#### Four years into my career I decided to go for it, to start a pet project of the first thing that came to mind. 
<br/>

I love travelling and before I leave for my destination, I have to check the weather, exchange rates, flight distance etc. All of this information in different locations. There we go, my first pet project. An app that provides you with all the information in one place. Great! I had an idea. The last decision was to choose a framework. I chose <a href="https://ionicframework.com/">Ionic</a>, purely because I have never developed a mobile app and it seemed to have a lot of documentation available. You can find my project <a href="https://github.com/annelledejager/reisagent">here</a> called “reisagent” which means travel agent in Dutch

# The myths

- My pet project has to be the next Facebook or else I’m wasting my time.<br/><br/>
<b>Truth</b> A pet project is never a waste of time. You’re constantly learning and becoming more comfortable with your tech stack or learning a new tech stack. Some projects can even improve your life eg. a mobile reminder app.

- I have to complete my pet project before I can move onto the next pet project.<br/><br/>
<b>Truth</b>  The beauty of having a pet project is that it’s yours. You decide what to do with it. No one will judge you if you leave a pet project mid way.

- It has to do something or fulfill a need.<br/><br/>
<b>Truth</b>  It does not have to do anything. If you want to practise your css, then your pet project can be to design a simple static web page with no functionality. It does not have to do ANYTHING! Pet projects are great for gaining confidence using unfamiliar frameworks eg. if you're a mobile developer with a web pet project

- You are a nerd for working on your computer over weekends.<br/><br/>
<b>Truth</b>  Even if this myth is true, so what if you’re a nerd. It's a new age where nerds are cool.

I usually choose an unfamiliar technology stack. I tend to prefer to start a pet project from scratch, but following a tutorial or forking a github project is also a great way to get up to speed with a new technology stack. 

#### I can't promote starting a pet project enough - it's yours, you own it, you have the power to commit to master.

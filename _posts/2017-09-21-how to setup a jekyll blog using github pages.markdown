There are plenty of articles out there to create a blog using Jekyll. Here are the high-level steps I took to create mine. The easiest way to get a great looking blog is to use Github Jekyll themes. There are quite a few to choose from <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/themes">here</a>. These themes are easy to customize later. 

Please refer to <a href="https://annelledejager.github.io/blog/2017/09/20/whyjekyll.html"><b>why I chose jekyll</b></a> post for an intro to Jekyll and why I chose it.

#### High-level steps
1. Choose a Github Jekyll theme, I chose https://github.com/bogoli/-folio/
2. Create a user account on Github if you don't already have one
3. Create a new repository named for example blog
4. Create a new branch in your blog repository named `gh-pages`

<blockquote>
GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service.
	â€”<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/">Github pages</a> 
</blockquote>

5. Remove the `master` branch, you will be commiting to the `gh-pages` branch from now on
6. Download your selected theme to your local machine
7. Get familiar with the theme, the directory structure and how you can customize it. Please see below.
8. Add the theme to your repository branch `gh-pages`
9. Go to your blog repository settings to find your blog url. You have to be the main contributor to see the `settings`. The url will look like `{username}.github.io/blog/`

#### Running Jekyll locally
1. Install Jekyll `$ gem install jekyll`
2. Go to the Jekyll repository on your local machine `$ cd blog/`
3. Run `$ Jekyll serve` (Jekyll provides a variety of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/">options</a>)
3. `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` in browser 

#### File structure

<ul>
	<li>_config.yml - important file where the configuration data live</li>
	<li>_site - this folder is generated, don't commit it and don't change it, because any changes will be overwritten</li>
	<li>_includes - partials that can be added to your posts for example</li>
	<li>_layouts - describes how your posts should look</li>
	<li>_posts - a folder containing your posts in the format YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</li>
</ul>

Jekyll will transform any .html, .markdown or .md files.

#### Front matter
Any file that contains a YAML front matter block will be processed by Jekyll as a special file. The front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines.

#### A frew tricky things
- If your css looks a bit weird in the browser, change the baseurl in the config file.
- Add your favicon link to the header.  If your favicon does not appear, refresh your browser cache.

{% highlight ruby %}
<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="{{ "/img/favicon.ico?" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
{% endhighlight %}

Start blogging!

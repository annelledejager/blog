<blockquote>
Budapest (Hungarian pronunciation approximates to "boo-dah-pesht") is the capital city of Hungary. With a unique, youthful atmosphere, a world-class classical music scene as well as a pulsating night life increasingly appreciated among European youth and, last but not least, an exceptionally rich offering of natural thermal baths, Budapest is one of Europe's most delightful and enjoyable cities. Due to its scenic setting and its architecture it is nicknamed "Paris of the East".

I moved to Budapest, Hungary in February 2017. Since then, I've tried to explore all the city has to offer. When friends come to visit they always ask me to provide a "things not to miss when in Budapest" list. So I've decided to put such a list together. 

Please keep in mind that everything I list here I've done or experienced over an eleven month period. Not to be tried within a weekend. 

### General information
<br/>
Budapest is divided by a river called the Danube. The one side is called Buda and the other is called Pest. The Buda part is hilly while the Pest side is flat. To me, Buda is more suburban while Pest is the city center where it's hustling and bustling. I lived on the Pest side for 11 months.

The main street is called Andrassy. This street is my beacon when I get lost. It's easy to find and its very recognizable. Shops in this street range from COS to Louiss Vuoitton. The oldest tram in Europe runs underneath this street. The yellow line. The train stations are decorated with tiles. It's worth walking down to one of the stations to check it out. Sisi or someone opened this tram line in blah blah blah. 

The Chain bridge is the most famous bridge that leads up to the Buda castle. You're greeted at the bridge by two giant lions on each side. Apparently the designer claimed he built the most realistic lion sculpture ever made, but after the resurrection someone commented that the lions have no tongues.

There are four metro lines that all get together at Deak Ference - the center of town. Deak Ference is a good meeting point. There is an outdoor mini swimming pool where young adults come together with a bottle of wine on Friday nights before heading out. You can put your feet it in. Deak Ference also leads to Vaci u. which is the most touristy area in Budapest which is to be avoided at all cost.

You can buy a can of beer at a store and drink it on the street. Soproni is the beer of choice for me. It is local and its from a town called Sopron which is the most Austrian Hungarian town. Sopron is located on the boarder of Austria. Sopron chose to be Hungarian twice when provided the option.

I use to visit Margaret Island weekly for a 5km jog around on a tar track. The island is a lush oasis in the middle of the Danube. There is a musical fountain that plays four times a day, at 10.30 am, 5, 6, 7 and 9pm. A variety of pieces are played, from Brahms to Bocelli, from Simon and Garfunkel to Vivaldi. 

On a warm summer's day, visit Palatinus Baths. They have thermal-, adventure pools and water slides.

Normafa is one of my favorite green spots with a panoramic view of the cities located 40 minutes by bus in the Buda Hills. Ideal for Summer jogs as well as Winter. In Winter, kids sled on the snow covered hills.

I've only visited three baths in Budapest. Rudas, Gellert and Schentenyi. My favourite is Schentenyi. Any travel guide or language book about Budapest will have a photo of Scehtenyi on its cover. It's very touristy, but def a must do. 

Gellert is located in a beautiful old hotel. Most of the bath is inside. Posch comes to mind. 

Rudas has an old and new section. The new section includes a roof top small pool that overlooks the Danube.

I'm not a cyclist at all, but I managed to cycle from Budapest to Szetendre and loved it. It's a perfect day trip. The town is cute, filled with lots of restaurants. If cycling is not your thing, you can reach Szetendre by train which takes about an half hour.

Ruin pubs are everywhere and its not just for the tourists. My all time favourite is Fogaz which is a mystical wonder filled with surprises around each corner. 

The classic Szimpla is definitely a must. I trip to Budapest without visiting Szimpla would be a sin. They also have a great caravan food court next door which have serve best burgers in town at Zing. 

Our local hang is Ellato Kert & Taqueria. Great if you want a great vibe and an affordable beer come summer or winter. 

* # Outdoor garden pubs

During summer, outdoor gardens start appearing from nowhere. Empty parking lots become lively scenes. My favorites is Mika Kert. 

Kertem is worth a visit. It's slightly out of way, but once you're there its boast a scene of bicycles, dogs, live music and laughter. 

360 is a rooftop bar, perfect in Summer. Slightly pricey.

Pontoon is perfect for Summer days and drinks after work.

The Citadel offers the best view of the Parliament. Take a few beers in your back pack, climb up just before sunset.

The Fisherman's Bastion was originally designed for aesthetics. Worth a visit. Entering Matthius church is a must. The moorish inside style sets this church apart.

The grand central market is worth visiting. Don't expect ready made food or to spend more than 15 minutes there. There are also less famous markets one can visit that sell the same produce. Produce includes raw meat, spices, fruits, vegetables etc.

Christmas markets open end November and are located in different areas around town. They're cheery and wonderful with lights and music. Drink a mulled wine and eat a chimney cake.

Frici Papa is a must. It's local, cheap, cozy. Try the poppy seed bread pudding, but share it, its huge. 

Cupakos has the best meat dishes at a good price.

Kiosk has the best vibe. Try the sliders, they're delicious. Visit in summer.

Moldi Tozi is a great cinema that shows movies in their original language. It is also a great bar. Eating popcorn and drinking beer while watching your favourite movie in your chosen language...great!

Treat yourself to a piece of cake at the most beautiful cafe's I've ever been to. Make sure to book and go after 11am when the quartet start to play.

The parliament building is beautiful from the outside with 365 towers. One can also enter the parliament. The tour lasts ± 30 minutes. It's OK to miss this tour in my opinion.

This square is a must see. You'll likely pass it on your way to the Ice Rink or to Scenteny bath. Spend ± 10 minutes here.

One can only become a saint if you do something magical. St stephen wasn't a saint, but when he died and they dug him up again, he's hand was perfectly preserved. This to the people of that time was a marical and he therefore became a saint. This can be explained today by science. The hand is still located inside the basilica. Its free to go inside.

Try to book a show at the Opera. The shows are amazing, the hall is amazing. You'll spend a night in glamour.

This is a fascinating church cave filled with history. I've never seen anything like it. The saint was placed into a barrel with nails and rolled down the hill. Worth a visit if you have more than a weekend.

* # Wine tasting

I started to learn how to drink Hungarian wine. They're most famous for their sweet wine from Tokai. They have plenty of other famous wine regions e.g Eger. Eger has a castle that the Turks attacked. The soldiers from Eger was completely out numbered so the commander decided to let his men die happy. He ordered all the wine from the sellers to be fetched and he invited all the soldiers to drink. The Turks, being from a Moslems, did not know what wine is so when the Hungarians started fighting the next morning with drunken bodies and stained red teeth, the Turks recalled the scene as bulls blood. Try the bulls blood at <a href="http://tastingtablebudapest.com/">Tasting Table</a>.

* # Dinner boat cruise + Folk dance

I find these kind of activities somewhat touristy, but the dinner boat cruise is definitely worth it. You get live music, a welcome drink, boat cruise and buffet dinner with all there is to taste in Budapest. The folk dance is great, but not a must in my opinion. 

* # Sziget festival

Sziget is an obvious must to me when you're here. There is something for everyone. I recommend staying over for a night. It's not fun leaving the party at 2am and still having to take a train in the cold for 20 minutes.

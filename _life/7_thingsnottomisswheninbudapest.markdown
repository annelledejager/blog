<blockquote>
Budapest (Hungarian pronunciation approximates to "boo-dah-pesht") is the capital city of Hungary. With a unique, youthful atmosphere, a world-class classical music scene as well as a pulsating night life increasingly appreciated among European youth and, last but not least, an exceptionally rich offering of natural thermal baths, Budapest is one of Europe's most delightful and enjoyable cities. Due to its scenic setting and its architecture it is nicknamed "Paris of the East".

I moved to Budapest, Hungary in February 2017. Since then, I've tried to explore all the city has to offer. When friends come to visit they usually ask me to provide a "things not to miss when in Budapest" list. So I've decided to put such a list together. I lived with a Hungarian tour guide for 7 months which gave me some insight and stories which I will share in this post. 

Please keep in mind that everything I list here I've done or experienced over an 11 month period. Not to be tried within a weekend. 

### General information
<br/>
Budapest is divided by a river called Danube. The one side is called Buda and the other Pest. The Buda side is hilly while the Pest side is flat. To me, Buda is suburban while Pest is the city center where it's hustling and bustling. I lived on the Pest side for 11 months.

	</figcaption>
</figure>

The main street is called Andrássy. This street is my beacon. It's easy to find and very recognizable. Shops in this street range from COS to Louis Vuitton. The continent's oldest metro runs underneath this street - the yellow line. The stations are decorated with tiles which makes it worth walking down to check it out. 

Andrássy connects Deák Ferenc, the city center, and Heroes' square. There are four metro lines that all meet at Deák Ferenc which makes this spot a good meeting point. There is an outdoor shallow swimming pool where people come together on warm Summer nights with a bottle of wine before heading out. You can put your feet it in - avoid swimming. Deák Ferenc also leads to Vaci u., the main shopping street. Shops include Zara, Mango etc. This is the most touristy area in Budapest. My advise is to  avoid it at all cost. 

Király Street is great when you're looking for bars or restaurants. It runs parallel to Andrássy.

The Chain bridge is the most famous bridge in Budapest. It leads up to the Buda castle. You're greeted at the bridge by two giant lions on each side. The lions don't have tongues and apparently the sculptor forgot to create it for them. There's a myth that says that when the rumor got unfold that the lions have no tongues the whole country made fun of him. He later committed suicide because of this by jumping off the bridge into the Danube.

### Language
<br/>
Hello and Bye - Szia<br/>
Thank you - Köszönöm<br/>
Thanks - Köszi<br/>

Note that Budapest is pronounced "boo-dah-pesht".

út (u.) - road<br/>
utca (ut.) - street<br/>
tér - square<br/>

### Currency
<br/>
Hungary uses the Hungarian Forints. Hungarian Forints/20 = 1 South African Rand

### Food and drinks not to miss
<br/>

You can buy a can of beer at a store and drink it on the street. Soproni is the beer of choice for me. It is local and its from a town called Sopron which is the most Austrian town in Hungary. Sopron is located on the boarder of Austria. Sopron chose to be Hungarian twice when provided the option.

I visit Margaret Island weekly for a 5km jog around on a clearly marked tar track. The island is a lush oasis in the middle of the Danube. There is a musical fountain that plays four times a day, at 10.30 am, 5, 6, 7 and 9pm. A variety of pieces are played, from Brahms to Bocelli, from Simon and Garfunkel to Vivaldi. 

On a warm summer's day, visit Palatinus Baths on the island. They have thermal-, adventure pools and water slides.

Normafa is one of my favorite green spots with a panoramic view of the cities. Its located 40 minutes by bus in the Buda Hills. Ideal for Summer jogs as well as Winter. In Winter, kids ride sleds down the snow covered hills.

	</figcaption>
</figure>

I've visited Rudas, Gellért and Széchenyi. My favorite is Széchenyi. Any travel guide or language book about Budapest will have a photo of Széchenyi on its cover. It's very touristy, but definitely a must do. 

Gellért is located in a beautiful old hotel. Most of the baths are inside. 

Rudas has an old and new section. The new section includes a roof top thermal pool that overlooks the Danube. 

* # Cycling to Szentendre

I'm not a cyclist, but I managed to cycle from Budapest to Szentendre which is a small town outside of Budapest. It's a perfect day trip. If cycling is not your thing, you can reach Szentendre by train which takes about an half hour.

Ruin bars are everywhere. Its not just for the tourists. My all time favorite is Fogas Ház és Kert which is a mystical wonder filled with surprises around each corner. 

The classic Szimpla Kert is not to be missed. I trip to Budapest without visiting Szimpla would be a sin. They also have a great caravan food court next door which serves best burgers in town. 

Our local bar is Ellato Kert & Taqueria. Its perfect if you want a great vibe and an affordable beer.

* # Outdoor garden bars
<br/>

<b>Rating:</b> *** <br/>
<b>When:</b> Summer <br/>
<b>Cost:</b> Depends on bar <br/>
<b>Ave time spent:</b> 1-6 hours<br/>

Outdoor garden bars start appearing everywhere in Summer. Empty parking lots become lively scenes. My favorites is Mika Kert. 

Kertem is worth a visit as well. It's slightly out of the way, but once you're there it boast a scene of bicycles, dogs, live music and laughter. 

360 Bar is a rooftop bar which perfect in Summer. They serve the best cocktails, but are slightly pricey with an entrance fee.

Pontoon is perfect for Summer days and drinks after work. Its situated beneath the Chain bridge.

The Citadel offers the best view of the Parliament and the rest of Budapest. Take a few Soproni's in your back pack and climb up just before sunset.

The Fisherman's Bastion was originally designed for aesthetics. It frames Matthias church. Entering Matthias church is a must. The Moorish inside style sets this church apart.

The grand central market is worth visiting. Don't expect ready made food or to spend more than 15 minutes there. Produce includes raw meat, spices, fruits, vegetables etc.

Christmas markets open end November and are located in different areas around town. They're cheery and wonderful with lights and music. Drink a mulled wine and eat a chimney cake.

<a href="http://fricipapa.hu/">Frici Papa</a> is a must. It's local, cheap and cozy. Try the poppy seed bread pudding, but share it, the portion is huge. 

<a href="http://cupakos.hu/">Cupakos<a> has the best local meat dishes at a good price.

<a href="http://www.kiosk-budapest.hu/">Kiosk</a> has the best vibe. Try the sliders, they're delicious. Visit in summer.

Gozsdu courtyard, once the core of Budapest's Jewish quarter is filled with restaurants and bars. Very touristy.

The parliament building is beautiful from the outside with 365 towers. One can also enter the parliament. The tour lasts roughly 30 minutes. It's OK to miss this tour in my opinion. Purchase tickets <a href="https://www.jegymester.hu/eng/Production/480000/Parliament-visit">here</a>.

One can only become a saint if you do something miraculous. King St Stephen was not a saint during his time. After his death, his burial was removed. During this removal they discovered that his right hand was perfectly preserved. The people of that time believed it had miraculous power. The king therefore became a saint. Scientists today can explain the phenomenon. The hand is still located inside the basilica. Its free to go inside. They also offer great classical shows inside the basilica.

There are tours to go inside the Opera house. I recommend to rather book a show. The shows are just as amazing as the hall.

<b>Rating:</b> * <br/>

The funicular in my opinion is slightly touristy and not a must in my opinion.

This is a fascinating church cave filled with history. I've never seen anything like it. Its named after a saint who was placed into a spiked barrel and rolled down the hill. Worth a visit if you have more than a weekend.

Hungary is famous for their sweet wine from Tokaj. They have plenty of other famous wine regions e.g Eger. 

<blockquote>
The name of the wine originates from an event that happened in Eger, the town, and region where the wine is produced, in the 16th century. Upon a Turkish siege of the city, the Hungarian troops (under command of the favorite hero of Eger today, Istvan Dobo), were fed local food and wine, including the red wine from nearby vineyards. Rumor spread that this dark red wine was mixed with bulls' blood to give the 2,000 soldiers strength. Indeed, this small band of defenders successfully fought back a much larger Turkish army, and Eger was temporarily saved from sacking.

I find these kind of activities somewhat touristy, but the dinner boat cruise is definitely worth it. You get live music, a welcome drink, boat cruise and buffet dinner with all there is to taste in Budapest. 

The folk dance is great, but not a must in my opinion.

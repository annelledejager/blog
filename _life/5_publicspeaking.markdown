# To state that I had a fear of public speaking is an understatement. Every time I had to speak in front of people, it would feel like a near death experience. 

This is not a post on "how to overcome public speaking". It is to show fellow sufferers that their not alone as well as my personal experience and how I dealt with it. I don't believe that there are steps that will work for everyone.

The first time I realized I had a major fear of public speaking was on a <a href="https://www.contiki.com/eu/en">Contiki</a> trip. It was on the first day in the bus. We all had to take turns to go to the front to introduce ourselves over the microphone. For most people, this is an easy task and they would not even think twice about it. For me, it was torture and an embarrassment. I've always found speaking in a group at work on "follow up" meetings i  groups as small as 5 people challenging. It is the anticipation of my turn that makes me anxious. The actual talking always seemed to go OK. I never thought much of it and brushed it off, because I'm an Engineer and speaking in public would never be part of my job. After the <a href="https://www.contiki.com/eu/en">Contiki</a> incident, I realized that public speaking is unavoidable and I would have to deal with it eventually. 

The sensation I would get as my turn were coming up was sweaty palms, dry mouth, twisting stomach pains, numbness over my face, chills, trembling limbs to name a few. It would feel like I'm not in control of my body and that I'm having an outer body experience. I usually also had the sense that I want to run away, as fast as possible. These are all signs of an anxiety attack. Afterwards I would always feel super tired and drained. 

This fear was well hidden, because when ever I had to give a talk, it was at university when I was well rehearsed and prepared. Social talks were my biggest fear. You would have to say something impromptu. Something funny, quirky or charming. I could never do that.

I started researching once I excepted that I had a major problem. I read through countless articles on how to overcome this fear, but I found the why articles much more comforting. My favorite sections is the following. I could completely relate. 

<blockquote>
You may not be aware of this, but each and every one of us has a cavewoman or caveman living inside our bodies. He or she is one of the many parts of the self. When our inner caveperson feels that it is being “singled-out,” primitive instincts kick in telling us that we are no longer a part of a group, and therefore, survival is slim to none. After all, how are you going to fight off a saber-toothed tiger all by yourself? The bottom line is, we feel threatened in a life or death kind of way.

So now I at least understood my problem. My strategy was to stay as far away from public speaking as possible. I rejected the opportunity to make a toast at my sister's wedding for example (which I now regret). 

# So how did I end up speaking at a conference?

When the opportunity arose to speak at <a href="https://gotober.com/2017">GOTO Berlin 2017</a> with a fellow colleague, I initially declined. I knew I had to stick to my initial strategy of avoiding public speaking at all cost. The opportunity kept pulling me. I didn't want my fear to hold me back in life. It was one thing to not speak in a social setting, but this fear started creeping into my professional life too. It was such a rare opportunity that I struggled to decide. I knew it was hight risk, but I felt like I needed to prove something to myself. I needed this challenge. I decided to do the talk.

I needed help now more than ever. I didn't want to merely "survive" the talk, I wanted it to be great. I knew I was going to have my usual symptoms before the talk. It was unavoidable. I would need a strategy to deal with theses symptoms rather than to wish for none at all. I also prepared myself mentally that I will make mistakes during my talk, but its OK. There is no point in visualizing the perfect talk. It does not exist. 

 I found the weeks before the talk the most challenging. I would have sleepless nights and minor panic attacks on a few occasions. These occurred because our presentation was not ready yet and there were a sense of the unknown. The attacks became less the more prepared I got. The interesting thing is that going through my talk calmed me down. 

 Most articles give advise on breathing, visualizing and other tips. I found none of them insightful or helpful in any way. The two tips that worked for me was

 The more I practiced, the more I liked my talk, the more I felt comfortable and at ease that I want to get my message across.

When ever I felt the usual pre-talk symptoms, I would try to convert those feelings into feelings of excitement. Being nervous is also adrenaline.

# The talk went great. I was over the moon. I felt like a new person. 

I've learnt that for me, the time leading to the talk is the worst. The actual talk is usually OK. It usually starts of shaky, but as I get comfortable, it becomes smoother until a point where I start to enjoy it. For others I've heard that they start comfortable and then it becomes shaky. 

Also, "you don't have to say anything funny or charming, just be yourself".

I'm not saying that everyone with a fear of public speaking should attempt giving a talk at a conference. I do, however, challenge you to understand your fear so that eventually you can challenge it
